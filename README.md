# GeneticAlgorithmKnapsack
Developed an optimization model for a "napsack" problem using JavaScript

# Why?
Good question... I was introduced to genetic algorithims during a quantative methods course. At the same time, I was learning JavaScript. What better way is there to test my understanding of both GAs and JS than by making one from scratch? I'm happy I did! Eventually, I presented my hobby project to co-workers. I've also shared that presentation in this repo.
