# Genetic Algorithms
This repo contains an optimization model for a "napsack" problem that was programmed in JavaScript.

# The Scenario
You’re leaving for an upcoming trip. You’re worried that your valuable possessions might get stolen if you leave them in your apartment, so you’ve decided to bring some items with you. Unfortunately, you’re driving a Honda Fit, which doesn’t “fit” much stuff. You want to find an optimal combination of items to pack in your car, which maximizes the total value of items you bring, without surpassing the available space in your car.

# Why?
Good question... I was introduced to genetic algorithims during a quantative methods course. At the same time, I was learning JavaScript. What better way is there to test my understanding of both GAs and JS than by making one from scratch? I'm happy I did! Eventually, I presented my hobby project to co-workers. I've also shared that presentation in this repo.
